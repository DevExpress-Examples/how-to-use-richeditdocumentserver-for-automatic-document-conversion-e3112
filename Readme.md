# How to use Word Processing Document API for automatic document conversion


This example illustrates how to use the [RichEditDocumentServer](https://documentation.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.XtraRichEdit.RichEditDocumentServer.class) to convert files from Word 2007 format to RTF format.

The **RichEditDocumentServer** is a non-visual equivalent of the RichEditControl for working with documents via API. Its advantages become evident in a simple application that automatically loads MS Word documents into a specified folder and its subfolders and saves them in Rich Text format. When a document is loaded, you can modify it in many ways, including mail merge.
